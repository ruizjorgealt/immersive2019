# immersive2019

                            Welcome to the Summer 2019 Operations Immersive Program Repo!

This is where you will be submitting any challenges/labs through a pull request.

TIPS:
1. Always create a new branch for each new assignment.
2. Make sure you are working on your own branch to avoid any merge conflicts.
3. Please make sure you are pushing to origin/master and not someone else's branch.
4. Feel free to create as much commits necessary to complete the assignment before merging to the repository.
5. Google is your friend! Don't be afraid to ask help from others!
