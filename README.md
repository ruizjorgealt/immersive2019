                            Welcome to the Summer 2019 Operations Immersive Program Repo!

This is where you will be submitting any challenges/labs through a pull request.

Steps:
1. Run the command `git clone 

TIPS:
* Always create a new branch for each new assignment.
* Make sure you are working on your own branch to avoid any merge conflicts.
* Please make sure you are pushing to origin/master and not someone else's branch.
* Feel free to create as much commits necessary to complete the assignment before merging to the repository.
* Google is your friend! Don't be afraid to ask help from others!
